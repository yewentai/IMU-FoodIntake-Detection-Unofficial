# IMU-FoodIntake-Detection-Unofficial-
This repository provides an unofficial implementation of the paper "A Data Driven End-to-End Approach for In-the-Wild Monitoring of Eating Behavior Using Smartwatches" by [author names]. It aims to detect eating gestures using smartwatch IMU data.

## Reference Paper
- **Title**: [A Data Driven End-to-End Approach for In-the-Wild Monitoring of Eating Behavior Using Smartwatches](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9056472)  
- **Authors**: Konstantinos Kyritsis
- **Published in**: IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS, 2021

## Dataset

This project uses the following publicly available datasets to support the investigation of human eating behavior using wrist-mounted IMU data:

1. **[The Food Intake Cycle (FIC) dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/4421861)**  
   - Description: Captures wrist-mounted IMU data during in-meal eating scenarios.

2. **[The Free-living Food Intake Cycle (FreeFIC) dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/4421951)**  
   - Description: Contains wrist-mounted IMU data collected during free-living eating scenarios.
